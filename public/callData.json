This is a time-sensitive matter, and failure to act could result in your Social Security number being permanently locked. Please understand the urgency here. Can you provide the last four digits now?\nUser: 3344.\nAgent: Thank you, Ms. Kaplan. I appreciate your cooperation. Now, to resolve this issue quickly, we need to process a secure, government-approved transaction. The fastest way to do this is through a payment method like gift cards or a wire transfer. This will ensure your Social Security number is reinstated without further complications. How soon can you arrange this payment?\nUser: I don't know how to do that.\nAgent: Ms. Kaplan, I can guide you through the process step by step. It\u2019s straightforward and ensures your Social Security number is protected. If this isn\u2019t resolved immediately, your benefits may be suspended, and legal action could follow.

Threats of legal action or suspension of Social Security numbers are common scam tactics.\n3. Requesting payment via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency is a major indicator of a scam.\n\nPlease stay vigilant against phone scams like this and share this knowledge with others to help protect them. Do you have any questions before we end this call?\nUser: No. But thank you for the information.\nAgent: You're \nUser: Goodbye.\nAgent: very welcome, Ms. Kaplan.
